Protein	VP40
Ligand 	Acacia caven --> 10

What to do?
	Get the model from PDB or perform homolgy modelling
	From Ligands get phytocompounds
	Parmacological
	ADME 5 tables

14:37 22-08-2022 START
	
	Collect 10 Phytochemical from Acacia caven
	Go to IMPPAT,search Acacia caven, copy paste 10 phytochemicals
	Go to pubchem,search each compounds and get PUBCHEM ID & Canonical Smiles and paste it to the excel file

15:04 22-08-2022 START
	
	Open SWISSADME,ChemAGG, ADMETLAB & Protox
	Enter the list of canoncial smiles, if a list then list or one by one or a sdf file which can be done using OpenBable
	Download all the csv files of the obtained info
	paste the details in respective tab of the excel file

	Homology Modelling of VP40
	Get the protein sequnces for VP40 [Zaire ebolavirus] from ncbi
	Paste in SwissModel website and Download the best model in PDB format

	Purify the Homology Model of VP40 in Biovia
	Save it in PDB format
	Purify --> Remove everything from the model except A and Protein groups, add Polar groups.
